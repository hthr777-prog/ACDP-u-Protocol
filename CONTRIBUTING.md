## 2. 📝 Authorized Communication Channels

The following types of communication are the only ones permitted for the public repository:

### 2.1 Critical Bug Reports
You may open an Issue to report a **critical, verifiable error** in the protocol’s internal logic, implementation documentation, or a factual error in an ontological example.

*   **Before reporting:** Please ensure the issue is an error and not merely a difference in philosophical interpretation. The report must relate to the protocol's stated purpose and structure.
*   **How to report:** Use the designated Issue template (if available) or format your report clearly, focusing on:
    *   **The Error:** What specific part of the protocol is incorrect?
    *   **The Impact:** How does this error affect the protocol's function?
    *   **The Correction:** Suggest a precise correction (only for factual errors, not ontological changes).

### 2.2 License & Commercial Inquiries
All inquiries regarding licensing, purchasing the **Enterprise Edition**, extending the trial, or commercial use must be directed to the Author via email.
