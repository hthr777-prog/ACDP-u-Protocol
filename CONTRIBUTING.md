### 2. 📝 Authorized Communication Channels

The following types of communication are the **only ones permitted** for the public repository:

#### 2.1 Critical Logic and Factual Error Reports (Bug Reports)

You may open an Issue only to report a critical, verifiable error in the protocol’s internal logic, implementation documentation, or a factual error in an ontological example.

* **Before reporting:** Please ensure the issue relates to a verifiable error (e.g., in a cited fact or an error in the stated structure), and not merely a philosophical interpretation.
* **How to report:** Use a designated Issue template or format your report clearly, focusing on:
    * **The Error:** What specific part of the protocol is demonstrably incorrect based on its *stated* purpose?
    * **The Correction:** Suggest a precise, factual correction (only for factual errors, not ontological changes).

#### 2.2 License & Commercial Inquiries

All inquiries regarding licensing, commercial use, or collaborations must be directed to the Author via email.
