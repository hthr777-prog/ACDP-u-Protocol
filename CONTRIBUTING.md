# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **ACDP Protocol**!  
To maintain conceptual integrity and ensure consistency with the **Essence Criterion**, please follow the guidelines below.

---

## 1. Before You Start

Before creating an Issue or submitting a Pull Request:

* Check whether a similar issue, discussion, or PR already exists.  
* Make sure your proposal aligns with the principles defined in the protocol’s `README.md`.  
* Verify that your suggestion does **not** contradict the core ontology philosophy of ACDP.

---

## 2. Content Rules (The Essence Criterion)

The central guiding principle of ACDP is strict **ontological neutrality**.

Please follow these content rules:

### 2.1 What *Not* to Do
* **Do not** create essences based on specific thinkers, schools, interpretations, or methodologies.  
  Classification must be based **only** on the inherent nature of the concept itself.
* **Do not** add political, social, or cultural examples unless they serve a clear and essential analytical purpose.
* **Do not** violate **Rule 1.5 (Consensus Protection)** by artificially equalizing concepts where an overwhelming expert consensus already exists.

### 2.2 What *Is* Acceptable
* Clarifications that reduce ambiguity.
* Improvements that enhance logical coherence.
* Additions that refine ontological distinctions according to the Essence Criterion.

---

## 3. Style Consistency

To maintain a uniform structure across the protocol:

* Use the same numbering pattern (1 → 1.1 → 1.1.2).  
* Use neutral, depersonalized, and ontologically precise language.  
* Avoid rhetorical or opinion-based phrasing.  
* Keep explanations concise and free from unnecessary examples.

---

## 4. Submission Process (GitHub Workflow)

All proposed changes must be submitted via a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### 4.1 Steps

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.  
2. **Create a new branch** with a descriptive name, e.g.,  
   `clarify/causality-section` or `fix/essence-definition`.  
3. **Make your changes** in that branch.  
4. **Write a clear commit message** summarizing *what* was changed and *why*.  
5. **Open a Pull Request**, including the required explanation (below).

---

## 5. Pull Request Requirements

Every PR must include:

1. **The Problem**  
   What ambiguity, inconsistency, or ontological issue are you addressing?

2. **The Solution**  
   A clear explanation of the change and how it aligns with the Essence Criterion.

3. **Testing**  
   If applicable, note whether your modification was checked against known ambiguity scenarios or protocol edge cases.

---

## 6. Review and Approval

* All PRs are reviewed by core maintainers.  
* Be prepared to discuss the ontological distinctions of any new essence introduced.  
* Once approved, the PR will be merged and tagged with the corresponding version in `VERSION_HISTORY.md`.

---

## 7. Code of Conduct

By contributing, you agree to maintain respectful and professional communication at all times.  
Disagreements should focus on the logic and ontology, not the individual contributors.

Thank you for helping maintain the integrity and clarity of the ACDP Protocol!
