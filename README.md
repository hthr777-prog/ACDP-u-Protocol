# ACDP – Universal Abstract Concept Disambiguation Protocol  
### Universal Edition (v6.3)

A protocol for identifying, decomposing, and neutrally presenting inherently ambiguous abstract concepts  
(e.g., “value”, “justice”, “reality”, “freedom”, “time”) that cannot be resolved by context alone.

# 📌 What is ACDP?

**ACDP** is a universal protocol designed to handle *deep* conceptual ambiguity —  
the kind that remains unresolved even with full linguistic, contextual, professional,  
or cultural information.

Unlike traditional WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation), which resolves surface-level ambiguity  
(e.g., “bank” = riverbank vs. financial institution),  
ACDP targets the *philosophical class* of concepts whose multiple meanings  
are equally legitimate and cannot be collapsed into a single interpretation.

Examples include:
- value  
- justice  
- reality  
- time  
- identity  
- fairness  
- autonomy  
… and many others.

The protocol operates **invisibly in the background** and is **never** shown directly to end users.

# 🎯 Core Innovation

ACDP systematically handles ambiguity that cannot be resolved by:
- linguistic context  
- professional convention  
- common knowledge  
- domain-specific frameworks  

Its innovations include:

- **Automatic detection** of context-resistant ambiguity  
- **Ontological decomposition**: by the nature of the thing itself  
- **Hierarchical mapping**:  
  **essence → aspects → sub-aspects → nuance-level distinctions**  
- **Source-based neutrality**: no single school of thought gets priority  
- **Consensus protection**:  
  scientific / historical consensus is respected and never relativized  
- **Compatibility with LLMs**:  
  the protocol functions as an internal reasoning layer for balanced answers
