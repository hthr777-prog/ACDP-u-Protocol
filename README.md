## 📌 What is ACDP?

ACDP is a universal protocol designed to handle deep conceptual ambiguity — the kind that remains unresolved even with full linguistic, contextual, professional, or cultural information.

Unlike traditional WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation), which resolves surface-level ambiguity (e.g., “bank” = riverbank vs. financial institution), ACDP targets the philosophical class of concepts whose multiple meanings are equally legitimate and cannot be collapsed into a single interpretation.

**The protocol operates invisibly in the background and is never shown directly to end users.**

Examples include:

* value
* justice
* reality
* time
* identity
* fairness
* autonomy
* … and many others.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

ACDP systematically handles ambiguity that cannot be resolved by:

* linguistic context
* professional convention
* common knowledge
* domain-specific frameworks

Its innovations include:

* Automatic detection of context-resistant ambiguity
* Ontological decomposition: by the nature of the thing itself
* Hierarchical mapping: essence -> aspects -> sub-aspects -> nuance-level distinctions
* Source-based neutrality: no single school of thought gets priority
* Consensus protection: scientific / historical consensus is respected and never relativized
* Compatibility with LLMs: the protocol functions as an internal reasoning layer for balanced answers

---

## 💡 Primary Use Cases

* AI Alignment (fairness, harm, autonomy, moral uncertainty)
* Philosophical education & conceptual analysis
* Ethics and public policy frameworks
* Cross-cultural communication of abstract ideas
* Ambiguous reasoning inside LLMs
* Research tools for conceptual decomposition
