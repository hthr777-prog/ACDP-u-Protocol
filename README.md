# ACDP–Universal
**Abstract Concept Disambiguation Protocol – Universal Edition**  
*A protocol for the identification, decomposition, and balanced presentation of abstract concepts with inherent ambiguity.*

---

## 📌 What is ACDP?

ACDP is a universal protocol designed to handle **abstract philosophical concepts** that remain ambiguous even with full context—concepts like "value," "reality," "time," "justice," or "freedom."

Unlike traditional word sense disambiguation (which resolves "bank" as financial institution vs. riverbank through context), ACDP addresses concepts where **multiple fundamental meanings legitimately coexist** and context alone cannot resolve the ambiguity.

The protocol bridges Wittgensteinian insights (concepts have multiple legitimate uses, no single "essence") with practical implementation: it systematically maps all ontological aspects of a concept, presents them neutrally, and lets users navigate the conceptual space without imposing a single interpretation.

**The protocol operates invisibly in the background and is never shown to the user.**

## 🎯 Core Innovation

**ACDP handles ambiguity that context cannot resolve.**

It combines:
- **Smart Threshold Test**: Activates only when linguistic/professional/factual context fails to disambiguate
- **Ontological Decomposition**: Classifies by the nature of things themselves (not by discipline, culture, or thinker)
- **Hierarchical Mapping**: Organizes essence-level aspects → sub-aspects → nuances
- **Neutrality by Design**: Presents all relevant perspectives without bias or premature resolution
- **Consensus Protection**: Respects established scientific/historical consensus while handling genuine philosophical diversity

## 🔬 How It Differs from Existing Approaches

| Approach | What It Does | ACDP's Difference |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **WordNet/WSD** | Resolves word ambiguity ("bank") via context | Handles concepts where context *doesn't resolve* ambiguity ("value," "justice") |
| **Frame Semantics** | Maps linguistic frames and usage patterns | Focuses on ontological essence, not just linguistic usage |
| **Ontology Engineering** | Builds knowledge graphs for factual/technical domains | Targets abstract philosophical concepts with no single "correct" meaning |
| **Wittgensteinian Analysis** | Deconstructs false philosophical questions | Constructs systematic maps of legitimate multiple answers |
| **Polysemy Research** | Studies words with related meanings | Addresses concepts with fundamentally different coexisting aspects |

## 💡 Use Cases

- **AI Alignment**: Handle abstract ethical concepts (fairness, harm, autonomy) without hidden bias
- **Philosophical Education**: Navigate complex concepts (consciousness, free will, truth) systematically
- **Policy & Ethics**: Address value-laden terms (freedom, equality, security) from multiple legitimate angles
- **Cross-Cultural Communication**: Recognize that abstract concepts may have different but equally valid interpretations

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ **Context-Resistant Ambiguity Detection** – Identifies when concepts remain genuinely ambiguous after context  
✅ **Automatic Activation** – Deploys only when needed (avoids over-formatting)  
✅ **Multi-Level Hierarchy** – Essence-aspects → sub-aspects → nuances as needed  
✅ **Source-Based Neutrality** – All perspectives backed by citations and balanced presentation  
✅ **LLM Integration Ready** – Works as system prompt for Claude, GPT, and other models  
✅ **Consensus Safeguards** – Never presents fringe views as equal to overwhelming expert consensus
