# ACDP – Universal Abstract Concept Disambiguation Protocol
Universal Edition (v6.3)

A protocol for identifying, decomposing, and neutrally presenting inherently ambiguous abstract concepts (e.g., "value", "justice", "reality", "freedom", "time") that cannot be resolved by context alone.

### 📌 What is ACDP?
A universal protocol for handling deep philosophical ambiguity that linguistic or professional context cannot resolve.  
The protocol runs invisibly in the background and is never exposed to the end user.

### 🎯 Core Innovation
Resolves ambiguity that traditional Word Sense Disambiguation cannot touch.

Key components:
- Automatic detection of context-resistant ambiguity
- Ontological decomposition by the nature of things themselves
- Hierarchical mapping (essence → sub-aspects → nuances)
- Built-in neutrality + protection of scientific/historical consensus

### 💡 Primary Use Cases
- AI Alignment (fairness, harm, autonomy, etc.)
- Philosophical education and research
- Ethics & policy deliberation
- Cross-cultural communication of abstract concepts
