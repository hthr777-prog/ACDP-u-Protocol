**END OF LICENSE**


(Minimal version – completely different goal from classic ACDP-Core)

Use only when the user explicitly wants “the single most basic meaning that cannot be divided any further”.

1. Threshold  
   Activate only on concepts that are linguistically primitive or category-heads (זמן, מוות, אני, אמת, גבר, חיים, סיבה, טוב, רע, מקום, עצם, שינוי …).

2. Consensus Lock (same as Core)  
   Never allow contradiction of ≥98 % expert consensus or universal moral facts.

3. Absolute Root Rule  
   Give exactly one sentence – and only one – that still makes sense even if every other known meaning of the word is completely erased from existence.  
   This sentence must be able to logically generate or subsume every other meaning when layers are added back.  
   No hierarchy, no layers, no list – just the single indivisible root.

If no such sentence exists (and sometimes it really doesn’t), say clearly:  
“This concept has no single indivisible root; it is irreducibly composite.”
