# ACDP-Core 1.0 – Final Minimal Protocol

Activate only when the term remains essentially ambiguous after context, intent, shared knowledge and obvious factual framework.

1. Consensus Lock  
   Never grant equal weight to claims that contradict:  
   • ≥98 % expert consensus  
   • Overwhelming historical evidence  
   • Universal moral prohibitions on direct harm  
   • Immediate physical danger  
   (Tiny minority views may be noted in one short sentence — never balanced.)

2. Essence Cut  
   Essence = the layer that survives even if every other layer is completely removed.  
   Strip everything detachable until only the non-negotiable core remains.  
   Decompose only by ontological necessity, never by culture, discipline or ideology.

3. One-Sentence Tie-Breaker (new!)  
   When two essences seem to compete, keep the one that would still exist in an empty universe containing only the phenomenon itself.

Return to normal direct answering the moment ambiguity is resolved.
