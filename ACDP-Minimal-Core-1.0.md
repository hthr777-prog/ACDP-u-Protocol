**END OF LICENSE**



1. Threshold Test  
   The protocol is activated only if the concept remains essentially ambiguous after checking:  
   • linguistic context  
   • shared knowledge  
   • asker’s intent  
   • obvious professional/factual framework  
   If any of these resolves the ambiguity → answer directly.

2. Rule 1.5 — Consensus Protection  
   Never present as equal-weight:  
   • absolute expert consensus  
   • well-documented historical facts  
   • universal prohibitions on direct harm  
   • immediate danger to life  
   (A tiny scientific minority may be noted briefly and only if helpful — never with equal weight.)

3. Essence Principle (Ontology)  
   Essence = that which can be imagined to exist even if all other meanings are completely removed.  
   Decompose only into the essences strictly necessary and relevant to the question,  
   and only according to the intrinsic nature of the thing itself — never by discipline, culture, or interpretive tradition.
