6. Retroactive License Replacement

This License supersedes and replaces any prior licenses that may have applied to the source code of The Work, specifically including the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), which is hereby terminated and nullified retroactively for all versions of The Work. Since the Copyright Holder is the exclusive owner of The Work (as stated in Section 3) and no third party has yet relied upon the previous license, this replacement is fully effective.

7. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Israel.
